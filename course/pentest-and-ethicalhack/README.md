# Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking

This is my summary of the [Cybrary's
course](https://app.cybrary.it/browse/course/ethical-hacking).

Summary of everything
[here](https://assets.ctfassets.net/kvf8rpi09wgk/1AdxrpIGkHnVVu4DFpZPP4/78506551e2c6c65e4e39ebbfe3f6e6c9/Penetration_Testing_and_Ethical_Hacking_Study_Guide__1_.pdf)

> NOTE: all IPs and domains are taken from the courses, they are not real.

## Module 1: Introduction

This is an introduction, explaining differences between hats, laws and other
infos

## Module 2: Footprinting

### nikto

It's used to find vulnerability on websites, it takes a lot of time to execute.

**Example**

`nikto -e 1 -h webscantest.com`

- **-e** evasion switch, the number *1* stands for *Random URI encoding*
    - This will help us being a little more stelthier
- **-h** define the hostname or IP address

---

### theharvester

It's used to find IP, email, and other information publicly available about a
company

**Example**

`theharvester -d microsoft.com -l 50 -b google -h myresults.html`

- **-d** is the domain or company name to search.
- **-l** is used to limit the results.
- **-b** is used to define our data source.
- **-h** allows us to use the Shodan database to query any discovered hosts.


## Module 3: Scanning and Enumeration

### nmap

It's used to scan the network, for IPs, OS information and much more

**Example**

`nmap -sn 192.168.0.1/24`

- **-sn** it disable port scanning, it's a simple ping request
- **-sS** TCP SYN port scan
- **-sT** TCP connect port scan
- **-sX** very noisy, only against linux machine
- **-sA** ACK switch
- **-p** allows you to specify a port number
- **-O** operating system detection

---

### hping3

It's used to send arbitrary TCP/IP packets to the host

**Example**

`hping3 -8 0-5000 -S 192.168.0.1`

- **-1** ping scan
- **-8** SCAN mode
- **0-5000** range of port to scan
- **-S** set SYN flag

`hping3 -c 1 -V -p 80 -s 5555 -M 0 -UPF 192.168.0.1`

- **-c** packet count
- **-V** verbose
- **-p** port number
- **-s** port from where we send packets
- **-A** ACK flag
- **-M** TCP sequence number
- **-UPF** set URG, Push, FIN flags
